As an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow, I will be examining how bumble bee niche dynamics are affected by genetics, temperature, body size, and phenology. In the summer of 2023, I am collecting pilot data at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in order to begin this project with [Dr. Shalene Jha](https://w3.biosci.utexas.edu/jha/) in the fall of 2023. I intend to collect data for this project in the summers of 2024 and 2025. Stay tuned here to see what I find!
