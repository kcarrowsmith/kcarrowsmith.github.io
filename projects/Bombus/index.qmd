As an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow with [Dr. Shalene Jha](https://w3.biosci.utexas.edu/jha/), I am examining how bumble bee niche dynamics are affected by genetics, temperature, body size, and phenology. In the summer of 2023, I collected pilot data at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory and will continue data collection in the summers of 2024 and 2025. Stay tuned here to see what I find!
