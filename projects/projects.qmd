  My research generally involves explores variation in plant-pollinator interaction patterns, looking at the drivers and consequences of such variation. Most of my work involves empirical data collected in the field, often at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory. I also utilize pollen DNA metabarcoding for much of my current work and am dabbling in species distribution modeling.

## Current Projects

These are just a few examples of my current work. My postdoctoral projects mainly focus on examining individual-level pollinator niche dynamics and how genetics, physiology, and environmental pressures influence these individual niches. Much of my work involves examining pollen collected by bees, and toward that end, I have begun exploring novel ways to improve pollen identification and quantification. I also have interests in climate-driven shifts in pollinator ranges and interactions.

## Doctoral Projects

These projects form the three chapters of my dissertation. Links to publications are included where appropriate. A full copy of my dissertation can be found [here](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/50709/Arrowsmith_washington_0250E_26069.pdf?sequence=1).
