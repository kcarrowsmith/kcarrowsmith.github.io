Hello! I am a community ecologist studying variation in plant-pollinator interactions. I am currently an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Texas with [Dr. Shalene Jha](https://w3.biosci.utexas.edu/jha/). Previously, I worked with [Dr. Berry Brosi](https://www.brosilab.org/) at Emory University and the University of Washington, where I received my PhD in July 2023.

This website is currently under construction. If you do not see what you are looking for here, please email me at kcarrows [at] utexas [dot] edu.
